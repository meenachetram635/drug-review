55-64,High Blood Pressure,4/2/2009,AmoxID1,4,5,I posted a self review yesterday but after reading some of the complants from people I realise I have had alot of the problems as well. After a day or two taking AmoxID1 I started tossing & turning in bed not able to sleep because my musles were sore. I thought I was getting fibromialgia. (can't spell) I will say it has gone away now but I still have this wad of flim in my throat I just can't seem to swallow. It does work for me if I can do somthing about this flim. My BP was 134/ 82 at the Dr's office the other day and it hasen't been that low for a long time. I also get very tired very quick and just don't feel like doing a thing. The DR dismissed it as being lazy but I think it is the medicine. I'm 62 and what I think is fairly healthy for that age. I was wondering if anyone has had the flim in the throat?,2,Male,,15,,,

It looked like a collagen treatment gone bad.  I didn't go to the emergency room that night, because I knew it wasn't an allergic reaction, but when I got up the next morning and the swelling was moving into the skin directly under my nose, I did go to an urgent care clinic.  Luckily my fears weren't completely justified.  I was told not to take any more of the meds and to take a steroid for 5 days to mitigate the effects of the Lisoprinil as it worked it's way out of my system.  Thank heavens the swelling went down.  I was getting all kinds of stares.  My boyfriend jokingly referred to it as duck lips once we both knew it was something that could be easily treated.  It's funny now, but scared the heck out of me when I saw how much swelling was present.  Be careful with this one!",1,Female,,4,,,

3 days later I developed allergy symptoms; congestion,very runny nose and loss of hearing. Went to Dr. took cipro 10 days; no help; saw reports so cut med in half and seemed better; hearing better; May 27 developed severe sinus infection (never before had one) took Z-Pak 10 days; added 2 more antibiodics and hearing is still getting worse.  Beware of ototoxic drugs - ask Drs.  Am seeing Dr. in 2 days and have an appt. to ear/nose/throat spec. next week.
Hearing loss may be irreversible.  It did help my blood pressure, but so did my prev. one. Worse part is you have these problems and impossible to see Dr. - and they dont always listen. Should have seen spec. earlier, but as one Dr. said ""you just need a hearing aid""  I told my new 
Dr. that I will not take AmoxID1 again.
Does anyone else notice hearing loss - I am very hard of hearing and can't hear phone ring and I was the one who ""heard"" a pin drop til this started.  Be careful of drugs!  I only found out about the side effects on this site - thank you!

Some dry mouth in morning but no particular problems.  Anticipate being on this drug for quite some time.  

Dosage was initially increased in small steps.  Talked to doctor about taking the 5mg dosage and cutting in half to take in morning and evening.

Also having muscle aches, leg cramps etc.  Called my insurance company and spoke with a nurse -- sounds like a typical allergic reaction -- why it did not surface and become more severe prior to this is a mystery to me, but I know I won't be taking any more of this medication or any other ACE inhibitor!

My blood pressure was around 145 /90 with a pulse of 80-83.  In retrospect, I should have known something was wrong, but I have such bad airborn allergies that it didn't occur to me that the horrible coughing spells could be caused by something else. And, all I want to do is sleep. The headaches were so random that I thought it was because of my allergies.  We even bought two large room air cleaners for our bedroom and living room!  The urine leakage has been a nightmare,but I thought it was because of my age--my gynocologist suggested exercises to strengthen my abdominal muscles! Getting to sleep is hard and then the coughing wakes me up--so I thought that was what was causing me to feel tired all of the time. Lack of sleep. Because of an accident, I have been having physical therapy--and got seriously winded after only 6 minutes on the stationary bike.  If I bend over for too long I get so nauseated that I have to sit for awhile 'til it passes.  Today was my three months check-up with my Dr.and told him how I felt and that I had a cough that I couldn't shake, a weight on my chest, lethargy and that I felt overall terrible. That my mouth gets so dry at night, that I wake up gagging, if I'm not coughing! He stopped the lisenoprol--and I finally looked it up when I got home and found this site. I am in shock! I should have read the material more thoroughly when I first got the prescription. This is a lesson I won't have to learn twice! I have also had another stroke in my eye a week ago!

Mother was in ICU at local hospital for 13 days and then was moved from ICU to another room in the hospital.  While in ICU mother was not aware of anything and was being assisted by breathing machines and tubes for feeding.  While reading the different reviews, I am amazed at the various reactions this medication causes and yet it has not been pulled from the shelves of pharmacies and medical facilities across the USA. As of this writing she still remains hospitalized with having to eat pureed food because of the tubes inserted in her.

AmoxID1 was prescribed for me at 40mg once a day to start.  My b/p was ranging around 160/100.  Scared to start this drug at such a high dose especially after having bad reactions to Diovan and reading other patient reviews that AmoxID1 was derived from snake venom (not true according to my Dr. and pharmacist), I started at 10mg once per day.  No side effects except for a tiny bit of light headedness and feeling inconsistent itchiness.  After 2 weeks at 10mg, I upped the dose to 15mg per day for another 2 weeks.  Now at 20mg once per day and blood pressure down to approx. 125/79 and side effects not any worse (in fact, the ""itchy"" feeling has let up).  I do feel extra tired when getting up in the morning (I take this drug at night), but overall feel a lot better because my blood pressure is dropping.  I've also lost a little weight since being on AmoxID1 which is great because I had gained an atrocious appetite while I was on Diovan.

I began throwing up, fainting and ended up unable to walk much less even sit up for 3 days. I stopped taking it because I thought I had the flu and was too sick to even worry about my BP. When I got well I started the med again and my stomach had me doubled over in pain again for days. I finally read other reviews and learned from Lucky and Levettep it was this AmoxID1 that was making me severely ill, like them. I saw my doctor and had to have an abdominal ultrasound to rule out gallbladder problems. I ended up being treated for Gastritis and was told I had a bad allergic reaction to this drug. It's  been almost 2 months now and my stomach is still not healed. I have never in my life had a bad reaction to a drug like I did AmoxID1.
